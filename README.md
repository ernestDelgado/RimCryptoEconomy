Got extra electricity to spare? Turn your power into cash. With Rim Crypto Economy, you can mine coins and sell them on the market for Passive Income. 
Got extra silver laying around? have it work for you, as they say. You can also Buy coins instead of mining them. Buy Low, Sell High, or heck try to break even at least.

Use the comms console to open the Crypto Exchange to buy and sell coins.  Coins follow a realistic crypto economy curve, where coins will typically go up and down together, so not just totally random prices. 

But of Course Beware, some coins can crash out of existence, leaving you with a loss in your investment. Or they can BOOM and leave you the wealthiest faction in RimWorld.

Open the HistoryTab and Select Graph > Crypto to see the Coin's activity. Use this to predict future prices. 

Note:
New Coins are randomly released about once a year on average.  
When a Coin crashes (marketCap < 0) The coins disappear from the game. (Not A Bug)
	
How to Use
    - Servers are found under MISC and after Electricity has been researched.
    - Select a pawn and then click the server to start the mining process. <--- IMPORTANT 
    - Comms Console gives access to the Crypto Exchange.
    - Buy and Sell your coins for their true value, meaning no Multipliers (0.6x,1.4x). Coin prices are RAW

Servers Produce Heat! so makes sure to Vent or A/C the room.

**This idea was originally thought of by OniJechto. However, this mod is re-done from the ground up. As a small time crypto investor myself, I used my knowledge of the market to create the most realistic simulation i could. Thanks for Subscribing =) Happy Tradings

The Code will be available on Github soon, Anyone is free to build off it.
