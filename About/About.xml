    Got extra electricity to spare? Turn your power into cash. With Rim Crypto Economy, you can mine coins and sell them on the market.
Use the comms console to open the Crypto Exchange to buy and sell coins. Coins follow a realistic crypto economy curve, 
where coins go up and down together, not totally random prices. BEWARE, some coins can crash out of existence, 
leaving you with a loss in your investment. Or they can BOOM and leave you the wealthiest faction in RimWorld. Happy Trading!
	
How to Use
    - Servers are found under MISC and after Electricity has been researched.
    - Select a pawn and then click the server to start the mining process.
    - Comms Console gives access to the Crypto Exchange.
    - Buy and Sell your coins. No Multipliers. Coin prices are RAW

Servers Produce Heat! so makes sure to Vent or A/C the room.
